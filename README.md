# OrganicRGB
This is a small Python project which helps to have ONE RGB design across all Devices in your computer.
This project still needs a lot of time before it can be used without the worst conscience and without spending a lot of time.
Please use this project only with the knowledge that it can be very buggy and still eats quite performance.
This project has no documentation yet and few comments in the code. It will take me a long time to get started.
